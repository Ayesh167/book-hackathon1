## Prompt

The original user prompt for generating the tasks.md file.

## Response snapshot

I have generated the actionable, dependency-ordered task list (`tasks.md`) for the AI-Native Textbook integration. This task list breaks down the core setup, AI-readiness configuration, user-experience hooks, integration stubs, and runtime intelligence preparation into discrete, manageable steps, organized by phase and user story.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed task list (`tasks.md`) has been created, providing a clear roadmap for the implementation phase.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (`specs/001-vector-embeddings-pipeline/tasks.md`)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The task list effectively translates the plan into actionable items, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
